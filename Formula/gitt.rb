# Homebrew formula for gitt, published to the danielkag/homebrew-gitt tap by the release workflow in
# danielkag/gitt, which fills in the version, archive name, and checksum placeholders below:
#
#   brew tap danielkag/gitt && brew install gitt
#
# The download is one macOS universal binary (arm64 + x86_64), so there is no per-arch branching.

  # `version` is deliberately absent: Homebrew scans 0.1.0 out of the URL, and stating it again is a
  # `brew audit` error. The `test` block below still reads it via `version`.
